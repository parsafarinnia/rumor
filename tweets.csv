580358055185027072,@damienramage @airlivenet Normal descend rate for A320 is 2500fpm. Now 4000fpm (for 8 minutes) which is much, but contrallable. #u4u9525

580356785065844736,@PascalSyn @airlivenet or think you do ? or it hasn‚Äôt been assessed ?
580358416478167040,@damienramage @airlivenet Plus they stayed more or less constant speed, which means they reduced throttle, so they were in control #u4u9525
580359925181870080,@PascalSyn @airlivenet what‚Äôs the exact procedure btw ? What altitude would you drop down to ? at which rate of descent ?
580358454881185792,@PascalSyn @airlivenet exactly. So emergency would be appropriate, for example in case of cabin decompression, right ?
580365061463629824,@PascalSyn that's just for the high
580359262909644800,@damienramage @airlivenet That would certainly explain why pilots set steap descend. Maybe they passed too quickly (oxygen masks?) #u4u9525

580352527885008897,@airlivenet @PollyR_Aviation is that a normal call in this situation ?
580359656750653441,@PascalSyn @airlivenet if they had, it‚Äôs likely the descent rate would‚Äôve been steeper and the speed not reduce, no ?

580325250996518913,@flightradar24 any idea why it'd flight so high?  It's a short flight, usually planes go at ~ 33,000 feet
580326880169082881,@janoschjerman @flightradar24 yes and no depends on other traffic, turbulence... they were 25 mins late so going higher = going quicker
581194671902195712,@marcepa49 @flightradar24 @isobelroe and have operated them in sumulators. Also on actual flights when I've been in the flight deck.

500399140572897280,@a_man_in_black @andybankertv @FOX2now @tomman1 And also obliterating your attempt to deny that he was the person that robbed the store
500395293675122688,@lilfer1234 @andybankertv @FOX2now and the last time i checked the eyewitness testimony overrides the testimony of the defident's friends
500393880462692353,@lilfer1234 @FOX2now possibly. He seemed frightened
500392623107223552,@tomman191 @andybankertv @FOX2now Obviously? So he took off his socks in the 5m between the video and getting shot? http://t.co/O8mE7LTuoc
500395125802278912,@lilfer1234 @andybankertv @FOX2now that's why the police's testimony has been considered law despite it contrasting what EYEWITNESSES said
500395360125464576,@tomman191 @andybankertv @FOX2now but reasonable doubt? Innocent until proven guilt? Nah, fuck it, let's execute him

500313720145207297,@rui_xu @flavius217 They can't release shooting info cause they are still interviewing witnesses. Media wanted this info.
500311506676756480,@rui_xu @jlpauk @flavius217 What case? It's totally cool to shoot unarmed people suspected of a crime!
500378492488253440,@spants @Tom_sveb @rui_xu @flavius217 What they also did was chose to not ignore facts that call in to question the witness' credibility.

500405868244910081,@Tom_sveb @flavius217 I blocked him, so you can leave me off the tweets. I won't see them, gives you more characters.
500401666454065154,@spants @Tom_sveb @rui_xu @flavius217 You're making an assumption about something based on other peoples actions, that's my point.
500399398132523009,@spants @Tom_sveb @rui_xu @flavius217 If he was shot in the chest how was he running away?
500381689399369730,@spants @Tom_sveb @rui_xu @flavius217 Ok, so you get accounts from the community he lives in where people already have a distrust in police
500320052449914880,@flavius217 And that's the point. That's what people are upset about, I think.
500311158138884096,@rui_xu @jlpauk also wrong venues and in wrong order. After his summary execution in the street, they are trying him through the media.
500310883684208640,@jlpauk @flavius217 They are releasing irrelevant info that doesn't affect the case of Michael Brown's shooting
500320131239518209,@Tom_sveb @spants @rui_xu @flavius217 That's two different arguments.
500319011955949569,@jlpauk @Tom_sveb @rui_xu @flavius217 What they did today was also a good way to taint the jury pool.
500310256598011904,@flavius217 @rui_xu How? They are giving info that the media asked for.
500321405540786176,@dissuade I believe I read something like Ferguson is 29% white but the PD is 94% white.
500384869419978752,@Tom_sveb @spants @rui_xu @flavius217 Was he shot in the chest or back? From 35' away or 3' away? Which wounds came first?

500405818769285120,@jlpauk @spants @rui_xu @flavius217 I'm relying on details agreed upon by the police and the witnesses.
500318794862960640,@Tom_sveb @spants @rui_xu @flavius217 Not releasing facts about that shooting is also a way to make sure they get good info from witnesses.
500381784425512960,@spants @Tom_sveb @rui_xu @flavius217 and you want to make a decision without any hard facts.

500320630156189697,@flavius217 @spants @Tom_sveb @rui_xu I don't understand the double standard of wanting all the info about the cop but Brown's past is safe.
500387313050845184,@jlpauk @Tom_sveb @rui_xu @flavius217 What? No it isn't. There is definitely no justification for deadly force once he was running.
500321053197864961,@Tom_sveb @spants @rui_xu @flavius217 What other info do they have ready to release? All they have said is this is why we approached him.
500383616283975680,@jlpauk @spants @rui_xu @flavius217 then tell me the people of Ferguson haven't EARNED some distrust.
500385894134992896,@flavius217 this turned out to be a very popular tweet
500389863561388032,@jlpauk @spants @rui_xu @flavius217 in your world, it's cool to shoot unarmed people in the chest, but not the back? Or vice versa?
500402902662262784,@Tom_sveb @jlpauk @rui_xu @flavius217 Simple: Mike Brown was Inspector Gadget.
500400101097889792,@jlpauk @Tom_sveb @rui_xu @flavius217 Yeah, I would totally expect a kid that's been shot to run away, get shot again, and decide to charge.
500311885120819200,@spants @rui_xu @jlpauk @flavius217 and that is part of what's distressing. Police screw up and make bad decisions in any system.
500322706760691712,@dissuade strongly agree. I know policing is a terribly high-stress job, but most people are not criminals.
500406172155777025,@Tom_sveb @spants And there was a struggle inside the car. How do we know Brown didn't get the gun and fire the shot during the struggle?
500399589417963521,@Tom_sveb @spants @rui_xu @flavius217 If he was shot in the back he was running away but shot in the chest he could have been charging.
500320369056948224,@dissuade it's also pretty upsetting that a kid was summarily executed for maybe stealing a pack of cigars.
500385933523304448,@Tom_sveb @spants @rui_xu @flavius217 No that you see this as a racial situation before you know anything.
500379521900503040,@jlpauk @Tom_sveb @rui_xu @flavius217 You don't want to see what's happening? Fine. Keep being naive. Good day.
500400629739573250,@jlpauk @Tom_sveb @rui_xu @flavius217 Rand Paul used those words BECAUSE of this incident. Just fuck off dude. Fuck off so hard.
500392542853406720,@jlpauk @spants @rui_xu @flavius217 Rand Paul, yesterday:  "Anyone who thinks race does not skew the application of criminal justice in this
500320501475332096,@jlpauk @spants @rui_xu @flavius217 the investigation (e.g., that officer had a facial injury).
500405661864566784,@jlpauk @spants @rui_xu @flavius217 that's an account FROM THE STL CO POLICE CHIEF
500405555282726912,@jlpauk @spants per chief belmar: "a shot was fired inside the car, and Brown was eventually shot about 35 feet away from the vehicle."
500384718496747520,@jlpauk @spants @rui_xu @flavius217 that I don't like racial profiling and think police should obey the law? That is definitely my agenda.
500315190529773570,@Tom_sveb @spants @rui_xu @flavius217 For you to declare he was executed without any facts is also as absurd.
500402352919445504,@jlpauk @spants @rui_xu @flavius217 confused how an unarmed person, charging, retreating, or standing still, is a threat to a cop 30' away
500320974697693185,@flavius217 Also per last press conf, local PD depts seem super disconnected and out of touch with African American community.
500385201181052928,@jlpauk @Tom_sveb @rui_xu @flavius217 They've already said he shot him once from the car. Christ.
500383364084686849,@jlpauk @spants @rui_xu @flavius217 why don't you check out the racial profiling statistics of the Ferguson PD? some real, hard facts.
500380753272635392,@spants @Tom_sveb @rui_xu @flavius217 I see a lot of people making assumptions with limited facts. We haven't even seen an autopsy report.
500405250755690496,@jlpauk @Tom_sveb @spants @rui_xu do you not even have a basic understanding why people mistrust police?
500386143943139332,@spants @Tom_sveb @rui_xu @flavius217 If he was shot in the chest or back is the biggest factor in who is right.
500407281486663680,@jlpauk there's a difference between an open mind and an empty one
500313920301588480,@rui_xu @flavius217 They can't tie the two together cause they are separate issues. Releasing at different times puts distance between them.
500312144421089281,@spants @rui_xu @jlpauk @flavius217 to have the Supreme Court declare open season for cops on the population is a deliberate decision.
500314894063767553,@flavius217 @rui_xu Are you saying they start at the end and don't explain why he was approached by cops?
500385684285190144,@Tom_sveb @spants @rui_xu @flavius217 Right there you just admired they are all bad witnesses if they have distrusts in cops.
500315174633766912,@dissuade p sure you know the answer to that question.
500406679176241153,@jlpauk why would the ferguson PD and STLCO PD release the information they've released and fail to mention that?
500392633760759808,@jlpauk @spants @rui_xu @flavius217 country is just not paying close enough attention."
500400605035507712,@jlpauk @spants @rui_xu @flavius217 who says it's false? There's a large &amp; documented history of this PD arresting too many blacks.
500315038541156352,@flavius217 I'm curious, had the suspect been white would the PD have acted the same?
500385150468116480,@jlpauk @spants @rui_xu @flavius217 everyone agrees he was shot once at close range and multiple times at 30+ feet.
500321227597021184,@jlpauk @Tom_sveb @rui_xu @flavius217 Why wasn't Dorian Johnson arrested if he was suspected of a robbery?
500404864443105280,@Tom_sveb @spants @rui_xu @flavius217 Did you see him stand 30' away and get shot? No. A few people who have a problem with cops did.
500315733633806336,@jlpauk @spants @rui_xu @flavius217 I don't think i did say that. I did criticize a Supreme Court decision I've read many times.
500415239163101184,@Tom_sveb An open mind waits for all the facts then decides. An empty one makes a decision before the investigation is over.
500384895319818240,@Tom_sveb @jlpauk @rui_xu @flavius217 LOL
500415578373627904,@jlpauk @flavius217 @Tom_sveb @spants UNSUBSCRIBE
500379159965618178,@jlpauk @Tom_sveb @rui_xu @flavius217 He admitted they stole cigars to DOJ &amp; StL County PD. He wasn't charged b/c he didn't commit a crime.
500415054559203329,@flavius217 @Tom_sveb @spants @rui_xu So no matter that evidence comes out during the investigation that's what you're going with?
500316587333652480,@jlpauk @spants @rui_xu @flavius217 and not releasing any facts is a real good way to make sure people pass judgment on the facts they have
500320873086476288,@jlpauk @spants @rui_xu @flavius217 it is! I both argued that the Supreme Court was wrong . . .
500321014816210944,@jlpauk @spants @rui_xu @flavius217 and that suppressing or selectively releasing info led to people deciding for themselves.
500320401369870336,@jlpauk @spants @rui_xu @flavius217 they've systematically only released information that makes them look good, even info that might taint
500322465323974656,@flavius217 White or Black the biggest prob people have with police is the attitude from cops. We are a guilty till proven innocent society.
500321569907150848,@jlpauk @spants @rui_xu @flavius217 an investigative report on the shooting?
500386029791371267,@FortClank it sure did. A boon to my #brand
500407571153694720,@jlpauk @Tom_sveb @spants @rui_xu dude, come on. This rogue cop apparently thought he was Judge Dredd and murdered an unarmed kid.
500320602520293376,@flavius217 Agree. Not worth the bullets whatsoever.
500406892644937728,@Tom_sveb @spants @rui_xu @flavius217 They didn't say who fired the shots in the car. The fact is we've only heard one side.
500400890126155777,@spants @Tom_sveb @rui_xu @flavius217 Has that info came out yet?
500405947253006339,@flavius217 @Tom_sveb @spants @rui_xu I do, but do you have a basic understanding of the judicial system? Let's hear both sides then decide.
500323321519800321,@flavius217 Perhaps they need to alter/improve their training.
500406011543703552,@spants @flavius217 ok
500384522840453120,@Tom_sveb @spants @rui_xu @flavius217 That right there tells me you are going into this with an agenda.

500369014195896320,@ZerlinaMaxwell What's more frustrating even than that is that this is exactly why they did it that way, and everyone is falling for it.
500368731764424704,@ZerlinaMaxwell Not surprising. #MichaelBrown
500365432902393859,@ZerlinaMaxwell so quit talking about a robbery, stick to the subject

500368681806073856,@ZerlinaMaxwell This is exactly what the #Ferguson PD &amp; their PR machine want-focus off their indefensible behavior.

500399784394764288,@LisaBloom he didn't say he didn't know about the robbery, it went out over radio, he said he didn't know #MikeBrown was a suspect

500380991035559937,@rolandsmartin I'm not sure there was a "robbery". Convenience stores keep tobacco behind a counter where you PAY first! IJS #MikeBrown
500379350563569666,@rolandsmartin Because jaywalking and stealing cigars are capital crimes. It's the classic "Blame the victim" defense.
500382426909392896,@Jurutha if u watch the tape, he reached over counter, still not grounds to shoot him from behind
500378498054500352,@rolandsmartin may be prudent to ask clerk if Brown was the one who hit him
500381074531569664,@rolandsmartin their account is getting worse and worse Roland
500385293103820800,@rolandsmartin when that didn't made logical sense, now it was jaywalking? And he felt the nd to use deadly force for jaywalking? Lol
500379949463654401,@rolandsmartin wasn't it just this morning they were saying it was the reason
500385105337417728,@rolandsmartin they've been throwing out one lie after another. And none of it makes sense. How was he "prime suspect" just minutes after?
500385005873680386,@Jurutha I hear ya, but u said the swishers were behind the counter and they were, no biggie
500379599185125376,@rolandsmartin &lt;&lt;he didn't know at all they still has a B.O.L.O out at 7 for the suspect
500387422417338368,Well, yeah.  He had to trash the name of a dead child before providing that little tid bit. @rolandsmartin
500378447597039617,@rolandsmartin initially, but found out about the robbery during the altercation
500396771345199104,@rolandsmartin ok so that was mike in the convenience store?
500379398525431809,@rolandsmartin SUSPICION of a crime results n DEATH of the unarmed in the #Black comm as a rule. #MichaelBrown #EricGarner #TrayvonMartin
500384398022565888,@sachibub10 you can't tell whether there was somebody behind the counter or not. Either way not related to shooting.
500378223977721856,Oh. So NOW the #Ferguson police chief says the cop didn't know about the robbery when he stopped #MikeBrown. The kid was "jaywalking"? BS!
501730232790183936,@scATX no he was walking IN the street big difference
500306952241840128,@scATX If they were criminals why did the police not arrest his friend right away?They shot one robber &amp; let the other go #MikeBrown
500282232855334912,@scATX You are supposed to not be biased when you're a journalist. Glad you can come up with that decision without knowing all the facts

500281536919642112,@scATX it's sound like they may have been racially profiling him as a suspect
500281094239817728,#MikeBrown wanted to walk down the street. And he is dead. And the #Ferguson PD is using his silence in death to make him a criminal.
500299816971546624,@NBCNews  that is him same hat and outfit at sceen still gave no right to kill him
500295400696586240,@NBCNews Is there a police report we can see? Initially, the police said the victim was stopped for walking in the street.  #Ferguson
500295308572893184,@NBCNews @JDBmsnbc  That guy is much fatter then Michael and older
500296225678045184,@NBCNews Easy to know if this is Brown by looking at what he was wearing when he was killed.  Has there been a positive ID for this?
500298399095074816,.@NBCNews why are the cops releasing this? Has nothing to do with later shooting.

500378499891605505,@thelittleidiot  @rollyberry So what?  The police still have to work within the confines of the law even if others do not.

501806249264959488,‚Äú@thelittleidiot: to be clear: an unarmed teenager. I guess you were witness to the altercation between the cop &amp; the suspect if not shut it
500377411469733889,@thelittleidiot not even if he IS stealing.
500387065650241536,@thelittleidiot Ok yes but why the outrage..police are human too &amp; make wrong decisions..what about when they get shot just 4 protecting us!
500379602435731456,@thelittleidiot agreed. Being shot for possibly stealing cigars isn't karma, it's excessive force that doesn't match the crime.
500398105162821634,@SteveBirdTweeet @thelittleidiot police are humans too and when confronted with that situation no training is perfect to predict a response
500379102353047553,@thelittleidiot Thanks for clearing that up. I was really confused about that. ;-)
500377826722201600,@thelittleidiot no but it shows this person's character and his disregard for the law and law enforcement this fact is highly relevant here.
500386677513154560,.@thelittleidiot a 300lbs aggressive young man might get shot if he attacks a cop.
500378287898918912,@thelittleidiot Yes but it does warrant being shot to death by the store owner. Its called Karma.  Guy has a rap sheet as long as your arm
500377145349521411,to be clear: an unarmed teenager POSSIBLY stealing a box of cigars does not warrant being shot to death by the police. #Ferguson

500291870736412672,@YourAnonLive Could've been a 60 count box which are ~$40. Box like this: http://t.co/HnBy8k86GG

500305311647817729,@bonedog84 @OpFerguson @YourAnonLive I stole gum from a drugstore as a kid. Glad Im alive to tell it.
500306310450003968,@iRondrea @nickk330 @YourAnonLive they have the whole thing on video..
500304092296912897,@InfectiousChris I meant in general. People went off the deep end and believed the 1st thing they heard or read. No matter how 1 sided
500291600501600258,@YourAnonLive @JillJhorvath The property would have been valued by store employee not cops. Retail cost as determined by business.
500305543802519553,@YourAnonLive I think perhaps they‚Äôre saying the entire wholesale box a store would use for display‚Ä¶as opposed to one package.
500298324365160450,@von_Steiner @OpFerguson @YourAnonLive Notice the top this says 2nd suspect.  Mike Brown is suspect #1.  Please read everything out there.
500299937771692032,@freewebcamporn @YourAnonLive man. in so heated over this
500297571856678912,@YourAnonLive @OpFerguson that's also not a robbery in most jurisdictions, it's a petty theft. (Eg Los Angeles)
500306749090324480,@iRondrea @nickk330 @YourAnonLive it was on the news where I live.
500306929412210688,@GdurhamGarrett @iRondrea @nickk330 ok, have you seen the video?
500298114675539968,@YourAnonLive @OpFerguson $50 ?! Shit.. Mane this is some nonsense the report don't even look right. Missing info allat
500294975481843712,@YourAnonLive @JillJhorvath The key here is the verbiage Theft,burglary,larceny, or Robbery? Robbery is the term in this report!
500308754194497537,@YourAnonLive @euIVmusic WHY does the time stamp say 11:51 on the report, but one of the stills of the robbery shows 11:53?
500297879831838720,@YourAnonLive @JayTheQuad it also says they didn't arrive on the scene for the first time until 8/13
500293362055151616,@YourAnonLive You should be focusing on the ROBBERY charge and not the SHOPLIFTING charge.
500297784134606849,@DeuceTony @YourAnonLive @OpFerguson they're not finished yet, didn't want to sign rough draft.
500303314106720256,@YourAnonLive @FrancoisKilljoy for real.. I buy a box for 15 bucks.
500306606597636096,@JillJhorvath  Robbery involves threat or the use of force or violence to take the property
500297973905895424,@YourAnonLive @OpFerguson so not even a felony... Haha
500297717432594432,@DeuceTony @YourAnonLive @OpFerguson I bet they just typed that up this morning.
500293253510754304,@YourAnonLive Actually it's pretty reasonable. Maybe do research before tweeting to the masses? http://t.co/gFeDyb1RrY

500303660220706821,@agentbell4272 @YourAnonLive why robbery..whats the difference between shoplift or robbery..I have not read report yet

500373096860487680,@usmc1872 @BrwnSkinGirly @CNNVideo no offense 2 u sir but unless he was reaching 4 a gun then there was no reason for this to happen
500359336359518208,@BrwnSkinGirly Fists are weapons, he could have done anything at anytime he did what he thought was right he has a family to go home to

500357587997831169,@BrwnSkinGirly @KoszikMeows @CNNVideo It was to show his mentality. To prove that he isn't as innocent as anyone thought he was.
500382101930143745,@kingpin7666 @CNNVideo you missed the part where he reaches in and takes these cigars? Passes them to his friend and takes some him self.POS
500367241888944130,@BrwnSkinGirly @CNNVideo even going extreme length to hire an actor that looks like Michael brown! Not saying murder was justified, it's not
500356480432754689,@BrwnSkinGirly @CNNVideo there doesnt have to be money stolen/ just stolen itemsto be a robbery, they said it is robbery bc the use of force
500352847351775234,@BrwnSkinGirly @CNNVideo so robbery can only be with money?Every time a black kid gets shot, all the black people say"He wasnt in the wrong"
500371514127310850,@BrwnSkinGirly @CNNVideo no need to thank im with u that stealing a 80cnt cigar shouldnt trump a kid who had a future. We all do stupid shit

500360127522693120,@BrwnSkinGirly the cop didnt know he was un armed he could have pulled out a gun and killed him, if he tazed him he could shot the cop.

500356909816631296,@KoszikMeows @CNNVideo to make him look like the bad guy.. Since there is no real reason for why they did it.
500359435911716864,@KoszikMeows if i were a cop &amp; he was unarmed ummm hello .. So he must've left his taser in the car ... ?

500939702565105664,@max843 @orangeseahorse @DanteB4u @Alasscan_ Dorian admitted from day 1.Now rumor has it that store never called 911 who called? 911 tape?
500302889429241856,@Alasscan_ @DanteB4u Alasscan it's a lie. Pics are fake. No robbery was reported! If true, police would have said it last week to stop riots
500345409500639232,AND that attitude will be their downfall too. Bet on it. @walteredwards2 @jaggy123 @DanteB4u
500344082804518913,@walteredwards2 @MsRock4Ever @DanteB4u To think after all this time a lame-assed story about stolen cigars is going to fly is beyond stupid!
500301270532370433,@orangeseahorse @Alasscan_ - Even if not innocent, no justification for violating rights, removing due process &amp; execution #Ferguson MURDER!
500319394325479424,.@bucci2028 @orangeseahorse @Alasscan_  - Wilson knew he intentionally killed an alleged suspect trying to surrender to him &amp; people saw it.
500292158344417280,Agreed, Dante! @DanteB4u @AlwaysThinkHow
500301396764532736,@Alasscan_ @DanteB4u It's a LIE. Police originally said confrontation started b/c cop told Michael to get out of street &amp; walk on sidewalk.
500289773525671936,More like @MsRock4Ever @DanteB4u why was #DarrenWilson trying to pull #MikeBrown into police car thru the window?
500317233047142401,@DanteB4u @orangeseahorse @Alasscan_ The let him die so he could not talk. Police station learned of shooting from the news not Wilson
500340428701712384,TYPICAL OF COWARDS AND BULLIES @AlwaysThinkHow @DanteB4u
500575842268098560,@Alasscan_ @DanteB4u All a damn LIE. Plant the image of a violent black man &amp; say he was a suspect. DID NOT WORK!

500319932585111553,@DanteB4u @orangeseahorse @Alasscan_ I know : (  but sicker part is we don't know if Michael was dead or the let him die so he couldn't talk
500279534420525056,@DanteB4u THIS IS MY FUCKING QUESTION!!!
500299354499198976,@DanteB4u @Alasscan_ Racist LIE to make it seem like innocent black child was a criminal. It will not work!! Police LIE may start more riots
500301957396193280,@DanteB4u @KatEdmiston There's no spin, cops blew it from day one by not releasing shooter's name! Trying to control the narrative w/liesüëéüö´.
500302395042439168,@DanteB4u You're right! Police said fight started after cop told Michael to get out of street, walk on sidewalk! He was never a suspect!
500281521841139712,@DanteB4u I could not agree more, it just plain sounds preposterous. And why did he NOT get OUT of the car. It has to be a huge LIE.
500304228653346816,@DanteB4u IMO no shot should've happened. Call was unarmed suspect, cop had full description, easy to find where he lived @orangeseahorse
500311345665810433,@coreybking @DanteB4u @CallsForJustice @nyblossom: Cop never mentions shooting. Dispatch never mentions robbery. http://t.co/jhZzCFUkmr

500292755885531138,.@MsRock4Ever @AlwaysThinkHow - The Barney Fife fear is real in #Ferguson, total excessive force is common practice. This was a murder!
500279160795721728,Question for #Ferguson police chief? If OFFICER DARREN WILSON was in pursuit of a robbery suspect, why tell kids to get out of the road? LIE
